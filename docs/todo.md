# TODO / Roadmap

A running list of ideas, tasks, and future features for the project.

## Short-Term
- [ ] Survey current research on swarm robotics and multi-agent systems
- [ ] Build a simple simulation of two robots following flocking or aggregation rules
- [ ] Summarize findings in docs/theory-notes.md
- [ ] Explore basic communication protocols for agent coordination

## Mid-Term
- [ ] Design initial hardware prototype (part list, basic design in hardware/README.md)
- [ ] Implement and test core swarm algorithm (in sim and/or algorithms folders)
- [ ] Log early experiment results in docs/experiment-log.md

## Long-Term
- [ ] Scale up simulation to >5 robots with more complex behaviors
- [ ] Begin physical prototyping (choose microcontroller, basic chassis, comms modules)
- [ ] Document lessons learned and adjust roadmap as needed
